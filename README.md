The project focuses on developing an AI Driven Insider Threat Detection System that ) that utilizes machine learning, behavioral analytics, and anomaly detection to identify suspicious activities within an organization's network. The system monitors user actions, access logs, and communication patterns to establish normal behavioral baselines and detect deviations that may indicate potential threats. By integrating User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA), real-time monitoring, and risk scoring mechanisms, the system can effectively classify insider threats, including data exfiltration, privilege abuse, and unauthorized access attempts.
